## Overview:
Each folder is related to a figure in preprint. In it, you'll find most of the data that you need to reconstruct the figures and version of the source code used to produced them denoted:
```
source_code_for_figure(s).ipynb
```
Most of the folders also contains a README.md that describes the data and so on. (If you don't find the information in the given README.md satisfying, you may find the necessary information in one of the others) \
(Also, the data that consist of sampling from large matrix product states have been omitted due to the associated memory requirements. The MPSs can be reconstructed from the 'Code' part of the repository.)
